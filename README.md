This was my first real little web project that involved CRUD.
It's not the craziest or best looking website, but its the website that hooked me into
web dev and so it means a lot to me.

I wrote this in early 2019 when I was still a beginner so the code is a bit sloppy.
I have refactored a little bit of it in 2020.
